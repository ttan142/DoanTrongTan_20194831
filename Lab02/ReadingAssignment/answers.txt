 Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this? 
 Answer:  Yes, Java allows us to create multiple constructor methods within a class, as long as they have different parameter lists. 
          In this case, we could create two constructor methods for a DVD class, one that takes a title parameter and another that takes a category parameter.
          Note that the two constructor methods have different parameter lists, which allows them to coexist within the same class.
